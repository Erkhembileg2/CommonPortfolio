                    <div class="scrollable-text">
                 <p> <b>I love failing, I fail all the time.</b> Life’s a lesson itself, opportunities to acknowledge that exist everywhere, failures and accomplishments are purely means to learn and improve as a person. We, humans, are made to reach our fullest potential, just like trees grow to be beautiful without any external validation, people are created to be virtuous and wise, the only true failure lies in forgetting that natural process. I proudly fail to break through my limits numerous times. The number of PR attempts I failed in the gym, the times when I attempted to solve coding problems over and over, from graphic design to video editing, I altered my daily routine more times than my little brother can count, I've failed more than the past version of me has even tried. My daily routine goes something like this: </p>

                   <p> A few hours before my education, I open my eager eyes as I arise from my morning slumber. I quietly slip out of bed to avoid waking my parents. While they are yet to awaken, I hurriedly prepare breakfast. During this, I arrange my clothes for gym and school, simultaneously preparing me to leave. As I'm hoping it will not be a leg day, I head to my gym. Each step to the gym fuels my motivation for the day ahead. The pain and joy of working out pump me with energy, setting me up for the focus convenient for learning. As I sit in class knowing about the importance of education, doing everything to understand the given problems, prolonging the fulfillment I gained throughout the morning. But it wasn’t always like this. </p>
               
                    <p>Morning. It felt agonizing and exhausting. I deserved to feel that way. Not only did I sleep late, but all of the bad habits that I accumulated throughout the years started to affect me. This went on for what it felt like forever. I began to question, “Is this all of me? Are these habits going to shape me into someone mediocre?” Despair and anxiety tackle me from all sides, which swiftly wakes me up from a lucid nightmare. But was it a nightmare? It wasn't. From that moment, I set goals knowing I could do better, which not only changed me physically, but more importantly, mentally.</p>
                
                    <p>Snapping back to the memory of the day, I feel grateful knowing my self-improvement journey has been going wonderfully. Before I knew it, class time seemed to be over. I bid my farewell to my acquaintances and returned home. I feel thankful as I'm greeted with my baby brother's smile as he yells, “Mom, bro is home." I smile back at him. I remind myself to stretch and meditate for the day, which makes me ready for my education in a valuable skill such as software development. I steadily shift into a focused state, learning a lot in a short time. A few hours later, my mother gently knocks on my door as she tells me, “Dinner is ready." I head to the dinner table, waving at my father, who had just arrived. As we all sat at the table, we started to enjoy an amazing dish. The joy and laughter filled the room with positivity. As I checked the time, a few hours before sunset had left, I began to do my homework and prepare for my exams. After I finish studying, I journal, thinking of anything I could do for the day to delay gratification and make my future self fulfilled and happier.</p>
                    <p>
                    I look out my window, and I realize the sun has set, reminding me to relax and read. From flipping through the pages of a book, I feel sleepy as I put my alarm on head to my bed, and doze off, ready to follow my routine for the next day.</p>

    <p>Since the pandemic began, I have developed a deep passion for chess. The game fascinates me because it is purely skill-based, with no element of luck involved. Each move requires careful calculation and strategic thinking to gain an advantage over the opponent. Chess challenges me to anticipate and outmaneuver my opponent, making it an intellectually rewarding pursuit. The beauty of chess lies in its complexity and the endless possibilities it offers, allowing me to continuously learn and improve with every game, oh also chess has more positions than the atoms of the universe.</p>
